# webserver

I spun up a server with python and flask.

This project served as a tutorial to teach myself some basic building blocks of making something simple and getting it live quickly.

I also got more practice on how to read documentation, leverage a framework (libary), and work through some annoying errors.

My next steps are to update the html, css, and javascript to turn this into a real website.
