# webserver

I spun up a server with python and flask.

This project served as a tutorial to teach myself some basic building blocks of making something simple and getting it live quickly.

I also got more practice on how to read documentation, leverage a framework (libary), and work through some annoying errors.

The website itself is unimpressive, but has all the core pieces that can be made into something better.

My next steps are to leverage a HTML template to improve the website.
