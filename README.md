# functioning website on a local server

This project served as a tutorial to teach myself how to make something simple and get it live quickly.

I initially spun up a server with python and flask to load a primitive website.

This gave me more practice on reading documentation, using a framework (libary), and working through errors.

My next steps are to turn this into a real website by improving the html, css, and javascript.
